## Entity-Component-System Library for Go

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/dradtke/ecs-go?tab=overview)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dradtke/ecs-go?tab=overview)

This package provides an Entity-Component-System implementation for Go,
inspired by the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/)
library for Rust. It is primarily an exercise to see how Go might be able to
achieve similar ergonomics with reflection, and I think the results are pretty
good.

See the tests and examples for usage.
